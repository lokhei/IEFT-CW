Coursework for IEFT

Used the Bristol Stock Exchange, a simulation of an electronic financial exchange, to assess the performance of the Parameterised Response Differential Evolution (PRDE) adaptive trading strategy, optimising its parameters across diverse market conditions. The PRDE implementation was then extended by incorporating a greedy variant of Differential Evolution, and subsequently evaluated.
